        <h1>Sarah Dowd</h1>
        <h7>Full-stack web developer with a passion for community and lifelong learning. Skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js, 
            with some experience with Sass and SCSS. I received my certificate in full-stack web development from the University of 
            Pennsylvania. Before I found my passion for coding, I studied health and wellness and became a certified health coach while 
            working multiple jobs in the restaurant industry. My experience has taught me the importance of balance, attention to detail, 
            and prioritizing multiple important tasks at once. While working as a food cost manager for several years, I developed 
            analytical skills that sharpened my problem-solving skills. My biggest takeaway from learning web development was not how 
            to know all the answers but how to find them. I learned there is great value in working as part of a team as a developer. 
            I also worked successfully on multiple projects as part of a remote team. Passionate about working with a company where I 
            can sharpen my skills and grow as a developer. My ultimate goal is to one day be able to offer web development services to 
            local businesses in my community to help them stay competitive in an increasingly digital world. </h7>
